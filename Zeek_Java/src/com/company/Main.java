/*
-> package in java is used to group or contain  classes.Like a folder in file directory


-> Class is a place inside which your functions exist.Keeps all functions inside it.

-> Functions does some work when you call it. Like plumber manage pipes and bathroom when you call.

-> Inside a function a code is written that is executed to do work

-> Naming Conventions
-> For Classes we use PascalConvention.For example- (AddTwoFunctions) means no space starting of every word capital.
-> For Functions we use camelCaseConvention.For example-(addTwoFunctions)  means no space starting of every word capital except first one.

-> class- keyword to declare class in Java.

->  public- access modifier represents visibility. i.e- Visible to all.

-> static- Core advantage no need to create object to invoke static method.

-> void- return type of method.void doesnot return any value.

-> String[] args- command line argument.

->System.out.println- System is a class and out is an object of print stream class
